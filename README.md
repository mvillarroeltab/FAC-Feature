# FAC-Feature
A feature to include into my FAC application

## Introduction

I have decided that out of the three examples in the FAC promp that can be converted into features, I want to do something that will make sense and integrate seamlessly with my application webpage. My application webpage is a portfolio of sorts with the twist that, instead of showcasing exclusively my projects it is meant to showcase myself, helping the people at FAC to get to know me a bit better, and explaining my reasons for joining FAC and my progress so far. As someone used to laying out a page and designing, my application webpage is meant to be an exercise of order, which will showcase my (for now) limited talents in web design and combine it with an accessible, readable and hopefully beautiful design.

## Planning

While prompts such as 'a tortoise race' or 'a fortune teller' definitely spike my interest as a javascript challenge


## Building

## De-bugging
